This repository contains the source code for the FULXERPRO INVESTORS client dashboard, an elite, futuristic interface designed to showcase a state-of-the-art portfolio intelligence platform.

The application is built as a **frontend-only project**, demonstrating advanced UI/UX concepts and direct integration with the **Google Gemini API** for generating dynamic, AI-powered content.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Portfolio Intelligence Dashboard**: A real-time overview of portfolio value, performance, and asset allocation.
- **AI-Powered Strategic Opportunities**: A dashboard widget that uses the Gemini API to generate cutting-edge investment tools and opportunities based on a core framework.
- **AI Visualization Studio**: An interactive studio where users can generate high-fidelity financial charts and visualizations by describing them in natural language, powered by Gemini's image generation capabilities.
- **Social Trading Insights**: A module to discover and follow top-performing traders, complete with a real-time search filter.
- **Secure Wallet Component**: A mock wallet interface with a QR code, transaction history, and a secure copy-to-clipboard feature.
- **AI Co-pilot**: A floating action button that opens a chat window, allowing users to ask questions about the platform. The Co-pilot uses the Gemini API with a system instruction grounded in the page's content for context-aware responses.
- **Dynamic Platform Guide**: A dedicated page that lazily loads a comprehensive guide to all platform features, generated on-the-fly by the Gemini API.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (with modern features like custom properties), TypeScript
- **Core AI Provider**: **[@google/genai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@google/genai)** for all AI-driven features.
- **Markdown Rendering**: **[marked](https://marked.js.org/)** for parsing and displaying markdown content generated by the AI.
- **Development**: No bundler needed; leverages modern browser features like ES Modules and import maps for dependency management.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

To run this project on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fulxerpro-dashboard.git
    cd fulxerpro-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Provide your API Key:**
    The application is configured to use an environment variable for the Gemini API key. However, since this is a static project, you will need to create a file to provide this key. Create a new file named `process.env.js` in the root of the project directory and add the following content:

    ```javascript
    // process.env.js
    const process = {
      env: {
        API_KEY: 'YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE'
      }
    };
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key.

3.  **Include the environment variable script:**
    Open the `index.html` file and add the following script tag inside the `<head>` section, **before** the main `index.tsx` script:

    ```html
    <script src="process.env.js"></script>
    ```

4.  **Serve the application:**
    Because this project uses ES Modules, you need to serve it from a local web server to avoid CORS errors. The easiest way is to use a simple command-line server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use the `serve` package.

    ```sh
    # Install the serve package globally (if you haven't already)
    npm install -g serve

    # Run the server from the project's root directory
    serve .
    ```

    The server will start and give you a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your browser to see the application running.

## üìù Backend Architecture Proposal

This project does not include a backend. However, a detailed proposal for a scalable backend structure and a list of core API endpoints can be found in the `api.md` file. This document serves as a blueprint for future server-side development.
